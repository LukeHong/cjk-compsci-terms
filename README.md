CJK computer science terms comparison
=====================================

Greater China, Japan, and Korea, the so-called [Sinosphere]
(<span lang="zh-Hant">漢字文化圈</span>[^1]),
have burrowed many concepts through Sinoxenic vocabularies from the West
since the modern era.  Some of them have their own translations,
but some have imported translations from neighboring countries.
In some translations, both native and foreign stems are combined.
As a result, Sinosphere countries share a lot of words,
but to some extent they have their own parts.
And this is no different in computer science translations.

This page contains comparison tables of how computer science terms,
mostly derived from English, are translated and called in
different regions of Sinosphere.

*[CJK]: Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages

[^1]: Literally, "Chinese character cultural sphere."
