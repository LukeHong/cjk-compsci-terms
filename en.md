Greater China, Japan, and Korea, the so-called [Sinosphere]
(<span lang="zh-Hant">漢字文化圈</span>;
literally: "Chinese character cultural sphere"),
have borrowed many concepts through Sinoxenic vocabularies from the West
since the modern era.  Some of them have their own translations,
but some have imported translations from neighboring countries.
In some translations, both native and foreign stems are combined.
As a result, Sinosphere countries share a lot of words,
but to some extent they have their own parts.
And this is no different in computer science translations.

This page contains comparison tables of how computer science terms,
mostly derived from English, are translated and called in
different regions of Sinosphere.

Introduction
------------

### Cognates

Cognates are words that are derived from one side or share a common
etymology.

For example, the English word <q>computer</q> and the Korean word
<q lang="ko">컴퓨터</q> (keompyuteo), the Japanese word
<q lang="ja">計算科学</q> (keisan kagaku) and the Chinese word
<q lang="zh">計算科學</q> (jìsuàn kēxué), that
are both meaning computational science, are cognates.

Cognates are indicated by the same colored border.

### <span lang="fr">Calque</span> (loan translation)

Calque is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal
word-for-word or root-for-root translation.

For example, the Chinese word <q lang="zh">軟件</q> (ruǎnjiàn) is a translation
of the English word <q>software</q>, which translates the English words
<q>soft</q> → <q lang="zh">軟</q> (ruǎn; *soft* or *flexible*) and <q>ware</q> →
<q lang="zh">件</q> (jiàn; *clothes* or *item*) respectively.

Matching words/roots between languages in this way are underlined
with the same color & shape.

### Homophonic translations

For a root transcribed from a foreign word,
the original word is displayed on the root.

For example, as the Japanese word <q lang="ja">コンピュータ</q> (konpyu-ta)
is a transcription of English word <q>computer</q>, it is displayed like:
<q lang="ja"><ruby>コンピュータ<rt lang="en">computer</rt></ruby></q>.

### Romanized pronunciation

The pronunciation of each word is shown in Latin letters in parentheses
below the word.  The transcription system for each language is as follows:

Mandarin (China & Taiwan)
:   [Hanyu Pinyin]

Cantonese (Hong Kong)
:   [Jyutping] (Linguistic Society of Hong Kong Cantonese Romanization Scheme)

Japanese
:   [Hepburn romanization]

Korean
:   [Revised Romanization of Korean][RR] (academic transcription for
    recovering morphophonemic elements[^1])

[^1]: <cite>Romanization of Korean</cite>.
      National Institute of Korean Language.
      [§ 3.8][Romanization of Korean § 3.8] (Korean).
